1. Explain One-Hot Encoding?
   Ans: One-hot encoding is a process used to convert categorical data, or data with text labels, into a
   numerical form that a computer can understand. It does this by creating new columns for each
   categorical feature and assigning a 1 or 0 (hot or cold, respectively) to each row to indicate the presence
   or absence of a particular feature. For example, if a dataset had a feature called "Gender" with three
   options - Male, Female, and Other - one-hot encoding would create three new columns, Male, Female,
   and Other, and assign a 1 or 0 to each row to indicate which option it was.
2. Explain Bag of Words?
   Ans: Bag of Words (BoW) is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) for representing
   text. It is a way of extracting features from text for use in machine learning algorithms. BoW is a model
   representation used to simplify the often complex task of understanding natural language. It is a process
   of representing text as numerical feature vectors. It is one of the most common techniques used in NLP
   for feature extraction and is used to represent text in the form of a bag of words. The bag of words
   model ignores grammar and word order, but keeps track of the frequency of the words in the text. The
   text is represented as a numerical vector in which each word is represented by a number indicating the
   frequency of occurrence in the text.
3. Explain Bag of N-Grams?
   Ans: Bag of N-Grams is a type of feature representation used in Natural Language Processing (NLP). It is
   a technique used to represent text data as numerical features, where each feature represents a collection
   (or “bag”) of adjacent words or “N-Grams”. N-Grams are a sequence of N words taken together, and can
   be a single word (Unigram), two words (Bigram), three words (Trigram), and so on. Bag of N-Grams is
   used in supervised learning algorithms such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and language
   modeling. The advantage of Bag of N-Grams is it captures the context of words in a sentence, which is
   especially useful when the meaning of words changes depending on the context.
4. Explain TF-IDF?
   Ans: TF-IDF (term frequency–inverse document frequency) is a statistical measure used in natural
   language processing (NLP) to reflect how important a word is to a document in a corpus. It is the
   product of two statistics, term frequency (TF) and inverse document frequency (IDF). The TF-IDF value
   increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document, but is offset by the
   frequency of the word in the corpus, which helps to adjust for the fact that some words appear more
   frequently in general. The weighting of TF-IDF is intended to represent the importance of a word in the
   document.
5. What is OOV problem?
   Ans: OOV (Out-of-Vocabulary) is a problem in natural language processing (NLP) where a system cannot
   handle words that are not included in its vocabulary. OOV words are words that the system has not seen
   before and therefore cannot understand or process. This is a common problem when dealing with text
   data, as unseen words appear frequently in natural language. To address this problem, NLP systems use
   techniques such as word embeddings, language models, and lexicon expansion.
6. What are word embeddings?
   Ans: Word embeddings are a type of representation for text data, where each word in the corpus is
   represented as a vector of real numbers. Word embeddings can capture semantic and syntactic
   similarities between words, allowing models to understand the meaning of words in context and
   accurately make predictions. They are widely used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications
   such as sentiment analysis, text classification, and machine translation.
7. Explain Continuous bag of words (CBOW)?
   Ans: Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) is a natural language processing model that predicts a target
   word from its context. The model takes as input a set of context words (also known as the “bag”) and
   predicts the target word that belongs in the context. CBOW is based on the idea that words that appear
   in the same context are likely to be related. The model uses the context words to predict the target word
   by taking into account the context of the words. The model is trained on a large corpus of text and learns
   to predict the target word from its context.
8. Explain SkipGram?
   Ans: SkipGram is a type of neural network architecture used mainly for natural language processing
   (NLP). It is used to predict a target word from its surrounding context, meaning it predicts the target
   word given a set of words that come before and after it in the text. SkipGram works by taking in a word
   and its surrounding context, and then outputting a probability distribution over all possible target
   words that could fill in the gap. The probability distribution is then used to determine the most likely
   target word, given the context. SkipGram is often used in word embedding techniques, where it is used
   to learn meaningful dense vector representations of words.
9. Explain Glove Embeddings?
   Ans: Glove (Global Vectors for Word Representation) is a popular word embedding technique developed
   by Stanford researchers. It is a type of word vector representation that uses a neural network to learn a
   vector representation of words from large datasets. The resulting vectors contain semantic information
   about the words that is useful for many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Glove embeddings are
   pre-trained on a huge corpus of text and can be used to represent any word in the corpus. The semantic
   information captured in the embeddings can be used to compute similarity between words, detect
   relationships between words, or even classify text. Glove embeddings are used in many NLP applications
   such as language modeling, sentiment analysis, and text classification.
10. What are Corpora?
    Ans: Corpora in natural language processing (NLP) are collections of written texts and spoken words
    that are used to train algorithms so they can better understand and interpret human language. They are
    made up of large bodies of text, audio recordings, and other types of data that are used to train
    algorithms to recognize patterns and features in language. Corpora are used to develop and improve
    models that can generate language and interpret it accurately. They can also be used to create resources
    like dictionaries, spell checkers, and machine translation systems.
11. What are Tokens?
    Ans: A token is a single unit of a language like a word, number, punctuation mark, or any other symbol
    that is used to form a sentence. In Natural Language Processing (NLP), tokens are the basic building
    blocks of a document, and they are used to identify and analyze the structure of a piece of text. Tokens
    can be words, phrases, numbers, punctuation marks, symbols, and even emoji. They are used to identify
    the different components of a sentence, phrase, or document and to determine how they are related to
    each other.
12. What are Unigrams, Bigrams, Trigrams?
    Ans: Unigrams are single words that are used to represent the meaning of a sentence. Bigrams are two
    successive words in a sentence that are used together to represent the meaning of a sentence. Trigrams
    are three successive words in a sentence that are used together to represent the meaning of a sentence.
13. How to generate n-grams from text?
    Ans: N-grams are a type of text analysis technique used to analyze the occurrence and frequency of
    sequences of words in a text. To generate n-grams from text, you can use a variety of Natural Language
    Processing (NLP) methods.
14. Tokenization: Tokenization is the process of breaking a sentence into individual words or
    phrases. This is a key step in generating n-grams from a text.
15. N-gram extraction: After tokenization, you can use an NLP library to extract n-grams from the
    text. An n-gram is a sequence of n tokens (words or phrases) from a sentence. For example, a
    bigram (2-gram) is a sequence of two words from a sentence, such as “air pollution”.
16. Frequency analysis: After extracting the n-grams, you can use frequency analysis to determine
    the most commonly occurring n-grams in a text. This can help you identify key phrases and
    topics in the text.
17. Visualization: Finally, you can use data visualizations to represent the data. Common
    visualizations used with n-grams are word clouds, bar charts, and line graphs.
18. Explain Lemmatization?
    Ans: Lemmatization is a process of text normalization in Natural Language Processing (NLP) which
    reduces words to their base form or root. It is very similar to stemming, but lemmatization uses an
    actual language dictionary to identify the root form of words. This process helps to reduce the number of
    unique words in the corpus, as well as helping to reduce the noise in the text. The output of
    lemmatization is usually more accurate than stemming and helps to improve the accuracy of the results
    of the NLP model.
19. Explain Stemming?
    Ans: Stemming is a process in Natural Language Processing (NLP) used to reduce a word to its base
    form or root. This is done by removing suffixes and prefixes from a word, such as "-ing", "-ed", or "-ly".
    Stemming is commonly used in search engines, as a way to reduce multiple words with the same
    meaning to a single keyword. This allows a search engine to find all words with the same meaning and
    return them in the search results.
20. Explain Part-of-speech (POS) tagging?
    Ans: Part-of-speech (POS) tagging is a process of assigning a part of speech to each word in a sentence.
    This is done by a computer program, using algorithms and statistical models. The most common parts of
    speech are nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and pronouns. POS tagging can help to disambiguate words
    that have multiple meanings, as well as to assign correct grammar to a sentence. For example, the word
    "run" can be a noun or a verb, depending on the context. POS tagging can help to distinguish between the
    two meanings. Additionally, POS tagging can be used to create a more accurate machine translation of a
    text.\
21. Explain Chunking or shallow parsing?
    Ans: Chunking or shallow parsing is a process of parsing a sentence into small chunks of information,
    such as individual words or phrases. This process is often used in natural language processing (NLP) to
    quickly identify key words or phrases in a sentence. The goal of chunking is to simplify the processing of
    a sentence by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable pieces of information. This allows NLP
    algorithms to more accurately and quickly identify the meaning of a sentence.
22. Explain Noun Phrase (NP) chunking?
    Ans Noun phrase (NP) chunking is a process of identifying and segmenting individual phrases in a
    sentence into their respective noun phrase components. This is an important part of natural language
    processing (NLP) because it helps to identify the main topics or concepts of a sentence and can be used
    for summarization and question answering. The goal of NP chunking is to automatically identify noun
    phrases in a sentence by using a set of heuristics or rules that define the syntax of noun phrases. This
    can be done using rule-based methods or machine learning algorithms.
23. Explain Named Entity Recognition?
    Ans: Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a process in Natural Language Processing (NLP) of locating and
    classifying named entities in text. NER is used to identify the names of people, places, organizations and
    other entities in text, and classify them into pre-defined categories. For example, a sentence like "John
    went to the mall" could be labeled with the categories "Person" (John) and "Location" (the mall). NER is
    an important step in many NLP tasks such as question answering, topic segmentation, and document
    summarization.
24. Explain the basic architecture of RNN cell.
    Ans: RNN cells are a type of neural network architecture commonly used in natural language processing
    (NLP) tasks.
    RNN cell is composed of three main parts:
25. Input Gate: Responsible for receiving input, processing it and deciding whether to update the
    hidden state or not.
26. Output Gate: Responsible for generating output from the hidden state.
27. Hidden State: This is a vector which stores information from the previous time step. It is
    updated by the Input Gate with new information from the current time step. This hidden state is
    then used to generate output at the current time step.
28. Explain Backpropagation through time (BPTT)
    Ans: Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) is a type of supervised learning algorithm used to train
    recurrent neural networks (RNNs). It is an extension of the standard backpropagation algorithm, which
    is used to train feedforward neural networks. BPTT works by unrolling the RNN over time and then
    performing backpropagation over the unfolded network. This allows the algorithm to calculate the
    gradients of the cost function with respect to the weights of the RNN. These gradients can then be used
    to update the weights in order to minimize the cost function. BPTT is an effective algorithm for training
    RNNs, but it has the disadvantage of being computationally expensive and requiring a large amount of
    data.
29. Explain Vanishing and exploding gradients
    Ans: Vanishing gradients refer to a phenomenon in neural networks where the gradient during
    backpropagation becomes increasingly smaller and smaller. This usually occurs when the model has
    many layers and can lead to the model’s weights and biases not updating as expected. This can cause the
    model to not learn as quickly and can even lead to the model not learning at all.
    Exploding gradients refer to the opposite phenomenon in neural networks, where the gradient during
    backpropagation becomes increasingly larger and larger. This can happen when the model has many
    layers and can lead to the model’s weights and biases updating too quickly. This can cause the model to
    overfit the training data and can lead to the model not generalizing well.
30. What is a common way to distribute training and execution of a deep RNN across multiple
    GPUs?
    Ans: One common way to distribute training and execution of a deep RNN across multiple GPUs is to use
    a data-parallel approach. This involves splitting the data across different GPUs, and then training the
    network on each GPU in parallel. The results from all GPUs are then aggregated together and used to
    update the model parameters. This approach allows for much faster training and execution of deep
    RNNs, since the workload is distributed across multiple GPUs.
31. Explain Long short-term memory (LSTM)
    Ans: Long short-term memory (LSTM) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is capable of
    learning long-term dependencies. It is well-suited to tasks such as natural language processing and
    speech recognition, where long-term context is important. The LSTM architecture consists of memory
    cells, input gates, output gates, and forget gates, which help the network remember information over a
    long period of time. The memory cells are responsible for storing the information, while the gates
    control the flow of information into and out of the cells. LSTM networks are trained using
    backpropagation through time and have been used to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a variety
    of tasks.
32. Explain Gated recurrent unit (GRU)
    Ans: Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture that is
    similar to Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, but uses fewer parameters and has fewer layers.
    Like LSTM, GRU has a gating mechanism that controls the flow of data within the network. The GRU
    architecture consists of two gates: a reset gate and an update gate. The reset gate determines how much
    of the past information to forget, while the update gate decides how much of the new data to use in the
    current state. The GRU architecture is designed to learn long-term dependencies, allowing it to capture
    and store more contextual information from the input data, enabling it to make more accurate
    predictions.
33. Explain Peephole LSTM
    Ans: Peephole LSTM is a type of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. It is an extension of the
    traditional LSTM network that allows for the direct connection between the current cell state and the
    current input gate. This direct connection allows the network to make use of more contextual
    information when making decisions about how to process incoming input. Additionally, peephole LSTM
    networks are able to better capture long-term dependencies in the data. This is particularly useful for
    tasks such as speech recognition and natural language processing.
34. Bidirectional RNNs
    Ans: Bidirectional RNNs are recurrent neural networks that process data in both forward and backward
    directions. This allows them to capture and process long-term dependencies in both directions, which is
    beneficial for tasks such as language modeling and machine translation. Bidirectional RNNs are
    constructed by having two separate RNNs, one that processes the data in the forward direction and one
    that processes the data in the backward direction. The outputs of the two RNNs are then merged in
    some way, typically by concatenating them together. Bidirectional RNNs can significantly improve the
    performance of machine learning models on tasks such as language modeling and machine translation.
35. Explain the gates of LSTM with equations.
    Ans: The gates of LSTM are used to control the flow of information into and out of the memory cell.
    The gates are defined by the following equations:
    Input Gate: i*t = σ(W_i · [h_t-1, x_t] + b_i)
    Forget Gate: f_t = σ(W_f · [h_t-1, x_t] + b_f)
    Output Gate: o_t = σ(W_o · [h_t-1, x_t] + b_o)
    Cell State: c_t = f_t * c*t-1 + i_t * tanh(W_c · [h_t-1, x_t] + b_c)
    Hidden State: h_t = o_t \* tanh(c_t)\*\*
36. Explain BiLSTM
    Ans: BiLSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory) is a recurrent neural network (RNN)
    architecture that processes input sequences in both directions with two separate hidden layers. It is a
    type of RNN that can remember information for long periods of time and can process both forward and
    backward sequences of data. It is a combination of two LSTMs, one processing the input sequence in
    forward direction and the other processing the sequence in backward direction. The output of both
    LSTMs are then combined and used as an input to a fully connected layer. BiLSTM is often used in
    natural language processing tasks such as sentiment analysis and language modeling.
37. Explain BiGRU
    Ans: BiGRU (Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN)
    architecture that processes input data in both directions, allowing the network to learn the context of a
    sequence of data more effectively. A BiGRU consists of two separate recurrent neural networks, one
    processing the input data in the forward direction and the other in the backward direction. The two
    networks then combine their output, allowing the network to learn the context of the entire sequence of
    data. This helps the network to better understand the data and is especially useful for tasks such as
    natural language processing and time series prediction.
38. Can you think of a few applications for a sequence-to-sequence RNN? What about a sequenceto-vector RNN? And a vector-to-sequence RNN?
    Ans: Sequence-to-Sequence RNN:
39. Machine Translation
40. Image Captioning
41. Text Summarization
    Sequence-to-Vector RNN:
42. Speech Recognition
43. Document Classification
44. Sentiment Analysis
    Vector-to-Sequence RNN:
45. Music Generation
46. Text Generation
47. Generative Art
48. Why do people use encoder–decoder RNNs rather than plain sequence-to-sequence RNNs for
    automatic translation?
    Ans: Encoder–decoder RNNs are better suited for automatic translation than plain sequence-tosequence RNNs because they are able to better capture the context of a sentence. An encoder–decoder
    RNN uses two separate recurrent neural networks, one to encode the source sentence into a fixed-length
    vector and the other to decode the fixed-length vector into a target sentence. This allows for more
    accurate translations because the context of the source sentence is better preserved.
49. How could you combine a convolutional neural network with an RNN to classify videos?
    Ans: A convolutional neural network combined with an RNN can be used to classify videos by first using
    the convolutional neural network to extract features from each frame of the video and then using the
    RNN to analyze the extracted features in order to classify the video as belonging to a certain class. The
    RNN will be able to look at the extracted features over a period of time and detect patterns that would
    not be visible if only looking at a single frame. The resulting classification should be more accurate than
    using either technique alone.
50. What are the advantages of building an RNN using dynamic_rnn() rather than static_rnn()?
    Ans: 1. Dynamic_rnn() is more computationally efficient than static_rnn() because it allows for variablelength inputs and does not require the user to specify the input sequence length prior to model training.
51. Dynamic_rnn() allows for greater flexibility in constructing the model, as it allows for the
    creation of more complex recurrent architectures such as bidirectional RNNs and stacked RNNs.
52. The dynamic_rnn() function also allows for efficient backpropagation through time, allowing for
    faster training and better performance on time series data.
53. How can you deal with variable-length input sequences? What about variable-length output
    sequences?
    Ans: For variable-length input sequences, one can use padding or truncation. Padding involves adding
    an appropriate value (e.g. zeros) to the beginning or end of shorter sequences, so that all inputs have the
    same length. Truncation involves discarding information from the end of longer sequences, so that all
    inputs have the same length.
    For variable-length output sequences, one can use a technique called bucketing. Bucketing involves
    grouping sequences of similar lengths together, and then training a separate model for each group. This
    allows the model to learn different patterns for each group and thus produce variable-length output
    sequences.
54. What are Sequence-to-sequence models?
    Ans: Sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models are a type of neural network architecture that is used for
    tasks like machine translation, text summarization, and conversation models. The architecture consists
    of an encoder and a decoder, which work together to transform an input sequence into an output
    sequence. The encoder reads in the input sequence and encodes it into a vector representation, while
    the decoder takes the vector representation and decodes it into the output sequence. This architecture
    has been used to great success in a variety of tasks and is a powerful tool for natural language
    processing.
55. What are the Problem with Vanilla RNNs?
    Ans: The primary problem with vanilla RNNs is that they are prone to the vanishing gradient problem,
    which is a phenomenon in which the gradients of the network weights can become so small during
    training that they are nearly impossible to update. This is because the gradients are repeatedly
    multiplied together over time and can quickly become much smaller than they were initially.
    Additionally, vanilla RNNs struggle to remember information over long time periods due to their limited
    capacity for long-term memory. Lastly, vanilla RNNs are difficult to train due to their sequential nature,
    as they require all of the previous data points to be input into the network before the current data point
    can be processed.
56. What is Gradient clipping?
    Ans: Gradient clipping is a technique used to prevent the gradients in a neural network from becoming
    too large. It involves clipping the gradients to a predefined maximum value, which helps to prevent the
    gradients from exploding, which can lead to instability in training. This technique can be used to help the
    network converge faster and more accurately.
57. Explain Attention mechanism
    Ans: A attention mechanism is a mechanism that allows a machine learning model to focus on a specific
    part of a given input. It is a mechanism that allows a model to focus on the most relevant parts of the
    input, while ignoring irrelevant parts. Attention mechanisms are used in many applications, such as
    natural language processing, computer vision, and reinforcement learning. The most common form of
    attention is the soft attention mechanism, where the model assigns weights to different parts of the
    input to emphasize the most important parts. By doing so, the model can better focus on the relevant
    information and make more accurate predictions.
58. Explain Conditional random fields (CRFs)
    Ans: Conditional random fields (CRFs) are a type of discriminative probabilistic model often used for
    labeling or parsing structured data. CRFs are a type of graphical model, meaning that they use a graphbased structure to represent the relationships between variables in the model. CRFs are used for a
    variety of tasks, such as part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and object recognition. Unlike
    other probabilistic models, such as hidden Markov models or naive Bayes classifiers, CRFs are able to
    take into account the relationships between variables in the model. This is done by defining a
    probability distribution over a set of output variables that depends on a set of input variables. This
    allows for more accurate predictions, as the model is able to learn how different variables interact with
    each other.
59. Explain self-attention
    Ans: Self-attention is a type of neural network layer that allows for a more direct representation of
    relationships between input elements. It does this by computing the attention weights of each element
    with respect to all the other elements. This allows the model to better capture the context of the input
    elements and the relationships between them, leading to improved performance. Self-attention is used
    in a variety of models such as transformer networks, transformer-based language models, and vision
    transformer networks.
60. What is Bahdanau Attention?
    Ans: Bahdanau Attention is a type of attention mechanism developed by Dzmitry Bahdanau and
    Kyunghyun Cho. It is a type of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) system that uses an encoder-decoder
    architecture with attention. The attention mechanism works by taking a set of input vectors and
    computing a context vector that is used to weigh each input vector. The weighted vectors are then
    combined to form an output vector. The output vector is used to decode the target language sentence.
    The attention mechanism helps the model to focus on specific parts of the input sentence and helps to
    improve the accuracy of the translation.
61. What is a Language Model?
    Ans: A language model is a probability distribution over sequences of words. It is a type of artificial
    intelligence algorithm used to predict the next word or phrase in a sequence based on the words that
    have already been inputted. Language models are typically used in natural language processing (NLP)
    applications such as machine translation, speech recognition, and text generation.
62. What is Multi-Head Attention?
    Ans: Multi-Head Attention is a type of attention mechanism used in neural network architectures such
    as transformers. It is used to capture multiple aspects of a sequence of data by applying attention to
    multiple different parts of the input sequence. This allows the model to learn a more complex
    representation of the data and to better capture complex patterns.
63. What is Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU)
    Ans: BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) is a method to evaluate the quality of machine translated
    texts. It was first proposed in 2002 by Kishore Papineni and colleagues as an alternative to existing
    methods of evaluating machine-generated translations. BLEU uses a modified version of precision to
    measure the quality of the translation. The score is calculated by comparing the predicted translation to
    a set of reference translations and computing the percentage of words in the predicted translation that
    also appear in the references.
64. What are Vanilla autoencoders
    Ans: Vanilla autoencoders are a type of neural network architecture that uses an encoder-decoder
    model to learn a compressed representation of data, known as an encoding, and then reconstructs the
    data from the encoding. The encoder part of the network takes in the input data and compresses it into a
    smaller representation, while the decoder part takes this smaller representation and reconstructs the
    original data as accurately as possible. The goal of an autoencoder is to learn a representation that
    captures the important features of the input data while minimizing the size of the representation.
65. What are Sparse autoencoders
    Ans: Sparse autoencoders are a type of artificial neural network which uses a sparse data
    representation as a way of reducing the amount of data used in the network. The sparse representation
    is achieved by a regularization technique called sparsity, which forces the encoder to only use a small
    fraction of the available input neurons. This technique is used for feature learning and has been
    successfully applied to image recognition, text understanding, and deep learning.
66. What are Denoising autoencoders
    Ans: Denoising autoencoders are a type of autoencoder neural network used for unsupervised learning.
    They are used to reduce noise from a signal by learning a representation of the input data. Denoising
    autoencoders work by adding noise to the input data, then training the network to reconstruct the
    original input from the noisy version. This helps the network to learn a robust representation of the
    data, which can be used for tasks such as classification and clustering.
67. What are Convolutional autoencoders
    Ans: Convolutional autoencoders are a type of autoencoder that use convolutional layers in the
    encoding and decoding of the data. They are used to learn useful features from the data and can be used
    for tasks such as image classification, image segmentation, and image generation.
68. What are Stacked autoencoders
    Ans: Stacked autoencoders are a type of deep learning neural network composed of multiple layers of
    autoencoders. These autoencoders are arranged in a stack, with each layer receiving input from the
    layer below it. The stacked autoencoders are used for feature extraction and representation learning.
    Each layer of the stack learns a representation of the data, which is then used as input to the next layer.
    This way, the deep learning model can learn a hierarchy of features and representations, allowing it to
    better capture the underlying structure of the data. Stacked autoencoders are a powerful tool for
    unsupervised learning, and have been used for a variety of tasks such as image recognition,
    dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.
69. Explain how to generate sentences using LSTM autoencoders
    Ans: LSTM autoencoders are a type of recurrent neural network that is trained to generate text. The
    autoencoder is trained to take in a sequence of words and generate a corresponding output sequence. It
    does this by learning to map the input sequence to an internal representation and then reconstructing
    the output sequence from that representation. The autoencoder can then be used to generate new
    sentences from a given input by using the internal representation to generate new words or phrases. To
    generate sentences using an LSTM autoencoder, the model must first be trained on a large corpus of text,
    such as a book or a collection of news articles. Once trained, the autoencoder can be used to generate
    new sentences by providing it with a seed sentence or phrase. The autoencoder will then generate a
    sequence of words based on the seed phrase. This process can be repeated until a satisfactory sentence
    or paragraph is generated.
70. Explain Extractive summarization
    Ans: Extractive summarization is the process of automatically creating a summary by identifying and
    extracting relevant phrases and sentences from a source document. It involves selecting important
    pieces of text from the source document and concatenating them to form a summary. It is a type of text
    summarization technique that focuses on finding the most important sentences or phrases in a
    document and extracting them to create a summary. This type of summarization is useful for extracting
    key facts and ideas from a large body of text, such as a book or article, and condensing them into a
    shorter summary.
71. Explain Abstractive summarization
    Ans: Abstractive summarization is a type of summarization technique that generates new phrases and
    sentences to accurately capture the meaning and essence of the original text. Unlike extractive
    summarization, abstractive techniques rephrase the original text and may include the author's own
    words and interpretations. Abstractive summarization methods use natural language processing and
    deep learning algorithms to generate summaries. They are often used in text summarization, question
    answering, document summarization, and machine translation tasks.
72. Explain Beam search
    Ans: Beam search is an algorithm used in artificial intelligence to find the most probable sequence of
    words in natural language processing, machine translation, and other applications. It is an extension of
    the breadth-first search algorithm. The main difference between beam search and breadth-first search is
    that beam search uses a fixed-width beam instead of exploring all nodes at a given depth. This helps to
    reduce the amount of time required to find a solution, while still allowing the algorithm to explore
    multiple paths. Beam search also uses heuristics, such as the number of words in the sentence, to prune
    the search space and make the algorithm more efficient.
73. Explain Length normalization
    Ans: Length normalization is a technique used to normalize the lengths of text strings in a corpus in
    order to make them comparable. The goal is to make sure that the same text strings are being compared,
    regardless of their length. This is often done by dividing the length of a text string by the maximum
    length of a text string in the corpus. This helps to ensure that all text strings are being compared on an
    equal basis, regardless of their length.
74. Explain Coverage normalization
    Ans: Coverage normalization is a method used to normalize the coverage of sequencing reads across
    multiple samples. It is used to account for the uneven coverage of sequencing reads due to varying
    library sizes or sequencing depth across samples. By normalizing coverage, researchers can compare
    samples with different sequencing depths on a more equal footing. Coverage normalization is often
    accomplished by calculating a “scaling factor” for each sample, which is used to multiply the sequencing
    depth of that sample to match the median sequencing depth of the entire dataset. This then allows the
    comparison of sequencing data from different samples on a normalized basis.
75. Explain ROUGE metric evaluation
    Ans: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a metric evaluation used to measure
    the quality of a summarization task. It is used to compare the automatically produced summary with a
    set of reference summaries that were created by humans. The ROUGE evaluation compares the
    summaries of two different systems and computes a score based on the number of overlapping n-grams
    between them. It also takes into account the length of the summary by comparing it to the average
    length of the reference summaries. ROUGE is a popular metric for measuring summarization quality and
    is used in many text summarization tasks.
76. Explain the architecture of BERT
    Ans: BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a deep learning model
    developed by Google that is used for natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as language
    understanding. The architecture of BERT is based on a transformer-based model, which is a type of
    neural network that uses attention mechanisms to process input data more efficiently than other
    approaches. The core component of BERT is its bidirectional encoder, which is a multi-layer transformer
    network that encodes text in both directions – forward and backward. BERT also uses a number of
    different techniques to improve its performance, including masking some of the words in the input text,
    training on large corpora of text, and using a special type of “pre-training” that allows the model to learn
    general language patterns. Finally, BERT can be fine-tuned to specific tasks by adding additional layers
    on top of the pre-trained model.
77. Explain Masked Language Modeling (MLM)
    Ans: Masked Language Modeling (MLM) is a type of language modeling technique used in natural
    language processing (NLP) to better understand language. It involves randomly masking (hiding) a
    portion of the input text, then having the model predict the original word or phrase. This allows the
    model to better understand the context of words and phrases, as well as their relationships with each
    other, so it can better predict the right word or phrase in the right context. MLM can be used for a
    variety of tasks, such as machine translation, question answering, text classification, and many more.
78. Explain Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)
    Ans: Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) is a task in natural language processing (NLP) used to train
    language models to predict the next sentence given a previous sentence. The model is trained on large
    corpora of text, and is used to predict the most likely subsequent sentence given the context of the input.
    The goal of NSP is to enable models to better understand the context of the input, so that they can
    generate more accurate predictions.
79. What is Matthews evaluation?
    Ans: Matthew's evaluation is an assessment tool used to measure the effectiveness of a particular
    program or intervention. It is used to evaluate the overall impact of a program on its intended target
    audience, including both positive and negative outcomes. It is also used to measure the effectiveness of a
    particular intervention against predetermined objectives. The evaluation includes an assessment of the
    program's impact on the target population, an assessment of the program's costs and benefits, and an
    evaluation of the program's effectiveness in achieving its goals.
80. What is Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)?
    Ans: Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) is a measure of the quality of a binary classifier. It takes
    into account true and false positives and negatives and is generally regarded as a balanced measure
    which can be used even if the classes are of very different sizes. The MCC is a correlation coefficient
    between -1 and +1, where +1 is the perfect prediction, 0 is no better than random prediction and -1
    indicates total disagreement between prediction and observation.
81. Explain Semantic Role Labeling
    Ans: Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) task that uses linguistic
    analysis to identify the semantic roles of each part of a sentence. It is used to identify the arguments of a
    sentence, as well as their semantic roles, such as agent, patient, theme, and recipient. It can also be used
    to answer questions such as “who did what?” or “what happened to whom?”. It is a form of shallow
    semantic parsing and is used to better understand the meaning of a sentence.
82. Why Fine-tuning a BERT model takes less time than pretraining
    Ans: Fine-tuning a BERT model typically takes less time than pretraining because the process of finetuning uses the already-trained weights of the BERT model as a starting point, while pretraining
    requires the model to be built from scratch. This means that the fine-tuning process can be much faster
    because the model has already been trained on a large dataset, so it can quickly learn the task-specific
    parameters. Additionally, the parameters from the BERT model can be reused during fine-tuning, so
    there is less time spent on training and more time spent on optimizing the task-specific parameters.
83. Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE)
    Ans: Textual Entailment (RTE) is a task in natural language processing which aims to evaluate the
    degree to which a hypothesis is supported by a given text. It involves an automated system which is able
    to determine whether a given piece of text entails, contradicts, or is neutral with respect to a given
    hypothesis. In other words, it is the task of determining if a given hypothesis is true or false given a piece
    of text. RTE has numerous applications in areas such as sentiment analysis, summarization, question
    answering, and machine translation.
84. Explain the decoder stack of GPT models.
    Ans: The decoder stack of GPT models consists of a series of layers, each of which is responsible for a
    different part of the language understanding process. The first layer is a token embedding layer, which
    takes the text tokens as input and produces a vector representation of each token. The next layer is a
    multi-head attention layer, which allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence at
    the same time. After the attention layer, several layers of Transformer blocks are used to further process
    the input sequence. These Transformer blocks, which are composed of multi-head attention and feedforward layers, allow the model to learn relationships between the words and how they interact with
    each other. Finally, a fully connected layer is used to produce the output of the model.
